## ✍ Bio / About Section  

I partner with digital agencies to help them win and deliver AI + automation projects they'd normally have to pass on.

Here’s what typically happens:  
- Your client asks for workflow automation or AI integration  
- You know it’s valuable but lack the technical depth  
- You either lose the deal or struggle with delivery  

That’s where I come in — as your technical partner for the discovery-to-delivery journey.  

**Recent win:** Helped an agency save their client ₹30,000/month by architecting a hybrid solution instead of expensive SaaS subscriptions. Delivered in 10 days.  

**How we work together:**  
→ **Discovery:** I join your client calls to map technical requirements (fixed $100)  
→ **Demo:** Build clickable prototypes that help you close deals (2-3 days)  
→ **Delivery:** Handle complete development while you maintain client relationship  

**My approach:**  
- Use AI tools to deliver ~3× faster than traditional development  
- Know when to build custom vs use existing platforms (saving clients ~80% on recurring costs)  
- Create reusable solutions you can sell to similar clients  

**Background:** IIT Dhanbad (Mathematics & Computing). Previously built systems at Jio & Nutanix. Now focused on helping agencies scale their technical capabilities under my brand (InsAct).  

Let’s talk if you have client opportunities but need a technical brain to execute them.
